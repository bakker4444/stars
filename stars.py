# Assignment: Stars
# Write the following functions.
#
# Part I
# Create a function called draw_stars() that takes a list of numbers and prints out *. 
# For example: 
#   x = [4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7, 25]
# 
# draw_stars(x) should print the following when invoked:
# 
#   ****
#   ******
#   *
#   ***
#   *****
#   *******
#   *************************
#
#
# Part II
# Modify the function above.
# Allow a list containing integers and strings to be passed to the draw_stars() function.
# When a string is passed, instead of displaying *, display the first letter of
# the string according to the example below.
# You may use the .lower() string method for this part.
# 
# For example:
# x = [4, "Tom", 1, "Michael", 5, 7, "Jimmy Smith"]
# 
# draw_stars(x) should print the following in the terminal:
# 
# ****
# ttt
# *
# mmmmmmm
# *****
# *******
# jjjjjjjjjjj
# 

def draw_stars(arr):
    for i in arr:
        line = ""
        for j in range(i):
            line += "*"
        print line

x = [4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7, 25]
draw_stars(x)
print "\n\n\n"

def draw_stars_2(arr):
    for i in arr:
        line = ""
        if isinstance(i, int):
            for j in range(i):
                line += "*"
        else:
            for j in range(len(i)):
                line += i[0].lower()
        print line

x = [4, "Tom", 1, "Michael", 5, 7, "Jimmy Smith"]
draw_stars_2(x)
